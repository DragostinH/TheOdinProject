Starting work on Flexbox after finishing up with the box model. Initially it was hard to wrap my head around margins, border, padding, content box but after practicing on the exercise and watching the Web Dev Bootcamp from Udemy its a lot more clear. It's also a plus that im working on my workstation instead of my laptop. Alright, lets get flexbox started.
